<h2>1.0 Background and Abstracts</h2>
<p>This is a mini report from my Msc Thesis where I show the workflow
and method applied in assessment of Spatiotemporal Risk and Risk Changes
for Rain-fed Agriculture in Ethiopia.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLIAMER</strong>*: The result of this assessment is not
intended for operational purpose of any form, this is mainly for
informative and showcasing building index models for risk assessment.

</ul>
<p>Drought in Ethiopia impacts agriculture severely. Previous drought
assessments neglected the temporal dimension, hindering proper
monitoring. This assessment used composite indicators to analyze drought
risk between 2000 and 2019 and the findings reveal that the first half
of the last two decades had more risk due to severe droughts and highly
exposed croplands. The years 2000, 2002, and 2008 experienced major
droughts.</p>

<h3>Drought Hazard Assessment</h3>
<p>The primary variables(Data and Sources Table) used to characterize
droughts was based on the concept of drought severity (DS), which is a
crucial parameter for assessing the intensity and strength of drought in
a given area (Zhang et al., 2015). DS is closely related to the water
deficit and is calculated by summing or averaging the absolute
differences between drought values and threshold values used for drought
identification (Vogt &amp; Naumann, 2018; Wang et al., 2018). The
assessment of drought severity was conducted at multiple spatial scales,
including pixel and zonallevels, over the period of 2000 to 2019.</p>
<p>In this analysis, drought severity was defined as values less than or
equal to -0.5, based on the work of Gustavo Naumann et al.Â (2019), and
areas with wet conditions were excluded from the studyâ€™s scope. The
severity of drought was determined by the magnitude of negative values
of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), with more
negative values indicating more severe drought conditions. Drought was
identified when SPEI values dropped below -0.5, indicating a deficit in
rainfall compared to atmospheric demand (Gebremeskel Haile et al.,
2020).</p>
<p>Once the drought threshold was established, regions experiencing
extreme drought were used to calculate the drought hazard index. The
first step involved calculating the yearly drought index at the pixel
level, which was then aggregated to the zonal level for further
analysis. This approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of
drought severity and hazard across different spatial scales and over an
extended time period.</p>
</div>
<div id="exposure-assessemnt" class="section level3">
<h3>Exposure Assessemnt</h3>
<p>The dataset used for the assessing rainfeed exposure ((Data and
Sources Table) is the annual land cover (LC) maps by the European Space
Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI), which provides consistent
300m resolution LC maps on an annual basis from 1992 to 2019 (Version
2.0.7cds) and 2016 to 2019 (Version 2.1.1) (Bontemps et al., 2013; Liu
et al., 2018).</p>
<p>The rainfed cropland in Ethiopia is the specific element under
consideration in this research, and the annual cropland areas were
extracted from the global dataset using R software (R version 4.0.2).
The areas of rainfed cropland were then calculated in relation to the
drought coverage areas. The outcome was an annual Hazard/Exposure
calculated on a regional basis for each of the regions, and the
percentage area of exposed areas was calculated using ArcGIS 10.3.1.
This allows for an assessment of the extent of exposure of rainfed
cropland in Ethiopia to drought events. Overall, this methodology
utilizes state-of-the-art remote sensing data and advanced statistical
tools to assess the hazard and exposure of drought events on rainfed
cropland in Ethiopia.</p>

<h3>Vulnerability Assessesment</h3>
<p>In order to assess the vulnerability domain, A total of 100 papers
were retrieved from the search, out of which 52 were selected for use in
this research. In addition, non-systemic literature reviews were
conducted through snowball sampling, resulting in the inclusion of 13
additional papers, making a total of 62 papers that were reviewed to
identify indicators for drought vulnerability (refer to Annex Table 7
for the list of indicators). The selected papers were analyzed using
MAXQDA (VERBI SOFTWARE 2020), and each indicator was identified using a
code. The indicators were then grouped into categories such as social
susceptibility, lack of coping capacity, environmental susceptibilities,
lack of adaptive capacities, agriculture, economic, governance, health,
land use, infrastructure, and social.</p>
<p>Data availability for the period of 2000-2019 was checked for the
identified indicators. The statistical datasets were retrieved from open
sources such as grey literature, country databases, statistical reports,
and scientific papers to ensure that the results can be validated and
reproduced (Frischen et al., 2020; Naumann et al., 2014). This rigorous
approach ensures that the research findings are based on reliable and
verified data sources, enhancing the robustness of the study.</p>
<p>The following checks were carried done on the dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicators and Data Cleaning</li>
<li>Missing values detection</li>
<li>Outliers Detection and Treatment</li>
<li>Multicollinearity Analysis</li>
<li>Data Normalization</li>

<pre><code>The results show that the first decade of the analysis experienced more severe drought events than the last decade. The years 2000, 2002, 2008, and 2009 were the most drought-affected years, while 2007, 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2019 were the least affected years. The central and southern parts of Ethiopia were more affected by drought, while the northern part was less affected.

The regions that were most affected by drought, in order of severity, were Dire Dawa, Harari, and SNNP, while Tigray, Afar, and Amhara were the least affected. The top five zones with the most severe drought events were Gedeo, Kembata Tibaro, Harari, Halaba, and Sidama, while Central Gondar, Southern Tigray, Wag Hamra, and Fanti were the least affected.

It should be noted that the results are based on average normalized values, and therefore, careful interpretation is required. The findings are consistent with previous studies on drought in Ethiopia, which have highlighted severe drought events in the years 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Additionally, the eastern part of Ethiopia received less rainfall compared to the western part.</code></pre>

<h3>Exposed Croplands</h3>
<div class="float">

<div class="figcaption">Exposed Cropland</div>
</div>
<pre><code>The analysis shows that croplands were more exposed to drought severity in the first half of the decade than the second half, similar to the trend observed in drought severity. However, there were variations in the years of exposure. While 2008 experienced the most severe drought, the year 2000 had the highest exposure of cropland to drought. This was followed by 2008, 2009, and 2001. In the second half of the decade, years 2017 and 2018 experienced the most exposure.

On average, the regions with the most exposed croplands were Dire Dawa (0.94), Harari (0.93), Addis Ababa (0.91), and SNNP (0.82). Tigray was the only region with no exposure of croplands to drought. When analyzing yearly exposure trends, SNNP had the highest exposure in 2000 and 2002, with about 99% of crops being exposed to severe drought.

On the zonal level, more than three-quarters of the zones with croplands had an exposure index greater than 0.54. The most exposed zones on average were Baseko, Mao Komo, and Dire Dawa, with 99% of crop areas being exposed</code></pre>

<h3>Vulnerability</h3>
<div class="float">
<img src="images/vulnerability1-1.png" alt="Vulnerability scores" />
<div class="figcaption">Vulnerability scores</div>
</div>
<pre><code>The vulnerability of different regions can be measured by indicators such as their coping capacity and social susceptibility. Based on these indicators, some regions are more vulnerable than others. For example, the regions of Amhara, Oromia, SNNP, and Afar are the most socially susceptible, while Gambela, Harari, and Benishangul Gumz are the least susceptible. Similarly, regions like Gambela, Addis Ababa, and Dire Dawa are found to be more lacking in coping capacities compared to regions like Oromia, Amhara, and SNNP which are the least lacking. By examining these vulnerability indicators, we can understand the reasons behind why some regions are more vulnerable than others.

Gambela, on average, is the most vulnerable region. However, its vulnerability is mainly driven by its lack of coping capacity, which scored the highest at 0.79 in the region. In contrast, its social susceptibility score is low at 0.30.</code></pre>

<h3>Spatial and temporal risk</h3>

<img src="images/Risk_result.png"

<div class="figcaption">Spatial and Temporal Trend in Risk</div>
</div>
<pre><code>The risk of drought in the country has decreased over the time periods studied. The years 2000, 2002, and 2008 had the highest risk index values, while 2012, 2019, and 2016 had the lowest. This finding is consistent with the hazard analysis conducted on a yearly basis, which showed that hazard values were highest in 2000, 2002, and 2008.

However, the drivers of risk varied over time. For instance, in 2008, the year with the highest drought risk, the main driver of risk was the exposed cropland. This was the highest ranking dimension of risk for all the time periods studied.</code></pre>
